Rebranding Your UForge GUI
==========================

The following sections cover information regarding rebranding elements of the UForge GUI. Most customizations are done using the ``config.xml`` and ``forge-config.xml`` files located in: ``/var/opt/UShareSoft/uforge-client/gwt/uforge/templates``. This is a relative path.

Once you have completed your changes, you will need to run the following command. This will stop Tomcat, integrate the changes and restart Tomcat::

	$ /opt/UShareSoft/uforge-client/bin/uforge_ui_update.sh

.. note:: Other than the sections indicated in this document, we recommend that you do not modify other elements of the configuration files, otherwise this may cause issues when using UForge Portal.
