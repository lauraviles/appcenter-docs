Configuring Cloudsoft AMP
-------------------------

Once your UForge platform deployment is complete you can configure `Cloudsoft AMP <https://www.cloudsoft.io/amp/>`_ in order to allow users to deploy published machine images directly to Amazon or OpenStack, without having to connect to their cloud account. Before you start the configuration, ensure that you have:

	* a running AMP server (version AMP-5.3 or Brooklyn 1.0.0-M1), see `Cloudsoft AMP documentation <https://docs.cloudsoft.io/operations/production-installation.html>`_ for installation
	* a configured user in AMP server that will be used by UForge to connect


To configure AMP to be compatible with UForge:

	1. On AMP server instance, run as root:

		.. code-block:: shell

			$ echo "brooklyn.jclouds.authorizePublicKey.extraSshPublicKeyData=true" >> /etc/amp/system.properties
			$ systemctl restart amp

	2. Download the UForge Brooklyn plugin from the `UShareSoft maven repository <https://maven.usharesoft.com/nexus/content/repositories/official/com/usharesoft/brooklyn/uforge-brooklyn-plugin/3.8.10/uforge-brooklyn-plugin-3.8.10.jar>`_.

	3. Install the UForge Brooklyn plugin into AMP:

		* Log in to the AMP Portal: https://[amp-instance-host]/brooklyn-ui-catalog/#!/
		* On the catalog page, click ``Upload to catalog``
		* Select and upload the UForge Brooklyn plugin file


To configure UForge to use the AMP instance:

	1. On each UForge webservice node and the UI node, in ``/etc/UShareSoft/uforge/uforge.conf`` uncomment and complete the following lines:

		* AMP_API_ENDPOINT=<The URL to access AMP server eg: http://amp-instance.com:8081/v1>
		* AMP_API_USER=<The AMP user password that uforge should connect with>
		* AMP_API_PASSWORD=<The AMP user password>

        .. note:: If you want to connect to your AMP server with HTTPS instead of HTTP, you can follow `Cloudosft AMP documentation  <https://docs.cloudsoft.io/operations/configuration/https.html>`_ to configure it. In this case your AMP_API_ENDPOINT should use the secure URL eg: https://amp-instance.com:8443/v1.

	2. Run the following command on the webservice node:

		.. code-block:: shell

			$ service tomcat restart

	3. Run the following command on the UI node:

		.. code-block:: shell

			$ /opt/UShareSoft/uforge-client/bin/uforge_ui_update.sh

	4. At this point the deployment feature should be available for the root user. In order to allow other users to use this feature, give them the entitlement ``deployments_access``. For more information on entitlements refer to :ref:`create-roles`.

		.. code-block:: shell

			role create --name launcher --entitlement deployments_access
			user role add --roles launcher --account someUser
