You can now invite users, share appliance templates, and post comments in the activity stream.

.. _workspace-activity-stream:

The Activity Stream
-------------------

Each workspace has an Activity Stream.  This is a log of the current actions being carried out by the members of the workspace (for example adding a new appliance template).

Members can also add comments to the workspace for other members of the workspace to see. For example, to ask questions or share information. Your comments will be posted in chronological order in the activity stream.

To add a comment in a workspace, do the following:

	1. Go to the ``Collaboration`` tab.
	2. If you have several workspaces, select the workspace you want from the drop-down menu at the top right.
	3. Enter your comment in the square.
	4. Click ``post``.

You can also post comments on a specific appliance that is shared in the workspace. For more information, see :ref:`workspace-appliance-comments`.
